### CPSC 120

* Lab 5

    Lab 5, part 1 was a favorite due to its structured approach to understanding modular programming concepts, such as calculating the area of a rectangle. The hands-on experience, collaborative nature, and emphasis on test-driven development principles made it an engaging and insightful learning experience. Moreover, the lab's focus on defining functions and working with multiple files provided a practical understanding of code organization and modularity, essential skills in software development.

* Lab 8

    Lab 8, part 2 was also a favorite as it offered a practical learning experience in implementing arithmetic mean calculations into code. The emphasis on command-line argument handling, precision in floating-point arithmetic, and real-world validation scenarios made it an engaging and insightful learning opportunity.

* Lab 10

    Lab 10, part 2 was a favorite because it involved building a C++ program using two-dimensional vectors to manage California's county population data. The main goal was to create the CountyIndex() function, enabling users to find a specific county within the dataset. The lab emphasized modular programming, iterative function development, and test-driven development practices code creation.
